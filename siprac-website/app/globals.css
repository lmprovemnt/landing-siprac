/* Force light mode for now to match design or keep dark if preferred. 
   The design looks light. The screenshot showed dark mode which broke the Header.
   I will set dark mode vars to same as light to force light theme for consistency with the design,
   OR I should make Header support dark mode. 
   Reference URL is likely light mode.
   Let's force light mode vars for now to be safe, or just ensure Header has bg-white text-black etc.
   Header is bg-white/80. 
   If body is black, it looks weird.
   Let's set dark mode background to white as well to match the "Landing Page" feel which is usually light.
